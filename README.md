Aliases that help me do stuff.

### Installation
This requires `zsh` to work.

1. `git clone` this repo
1. `cd` into clone
1. Run `zsh install.zsh`

**NOTE**: The installation script depends on `$PWD`, so attempting to install from anywhere but where the repo is cloned (e.g., `zsh /path/to/zhorts/install.zsh`) won't work.
